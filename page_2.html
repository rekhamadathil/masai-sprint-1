<div class="flex-box" id="box1">
    <div>In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering.</div>
  

  <div>In common language usage, "fruit" normally means the fleshy seed-associated structures of a plant that are sweet or sour, and edible in the raw state, such as apples, bananas, grapes, lemons, oranges, and strawberries. On the other hand, in botanical usage, "fruit" includes many structures that are not commonly called "fruits", such as bean pods, corn kernels, tomatoes, and wheat grains.</div>
</div>

  <div class="flex-box" id="box2">
    <div>A fruit results from maturation of one or more flowers, and the gynoecium of the flower(s) forms all or part of the fruit.
<br>
      There are three general modes of fruit development:
      <br>
      Apocarpous fruits develop from a single flower having one or more separate carpels, and they are the simplest fruits.
      Syncarpous fruits develop from a single gynoecium having two or more carpels fused together.
      Multiple fruits form from many different flowers.</div>
